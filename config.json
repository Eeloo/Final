    "rules" : "1. Keep your discussions on topic for the text channel you are in. \n2. Keep all spam in the official designated Kerbin Spam Server: https://discord.gg/pmXNj. \n3If you are told not to do something on the discord, especially by an admin, don't do it. \n4. Violation of these rules can lead to punishments up to and including banning from the discord, although minor deviation from rule 1 is mostly acceptable. \n5. No discussion of the 2016 US general elections. \n6. In order to be canon, objects, structures, and technologies not already in the real world must be given a reason for why it is possible with Modern Tech. /n7. Pleas to be unmuted will not be recognized. \n8. This discord is an OOC location for the main nationstates RP. Do not confuse it otherwise. \n9. Do not yell at new nations to do what you want, at least wait for them to get a grip of things before recruiting and such. \n10. Don't invite people to the discord if they have no idea what it is. Get them to make a nation first, then give them the invite. And make sure they are actually interested in participating in the serious RP. \n11. If you do not have a nation and are not participatory you may be kicked. \n12. Even if a discord channel doesn't have the word respectful in its name, you still need to be respectful or you will be kicked/muted.",
